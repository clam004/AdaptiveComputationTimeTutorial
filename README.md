# Tutorial on Adaptive Computation Time for Recurrent Neural Networks

This jupyter notebook is a tutorial and demonstration implementation of Alex Graves's paper [Adaptive Computation Time for Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08983.pdf). Code is based on previous PyTorch implementation by [Jason Phang](https://github.com/zphang/adaptive-computation-time-pytorch)
